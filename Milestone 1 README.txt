Game Programming 2 Project

Milestone 1: 10-1-18
This milestone contains the basic level for the game, a basic player movement system, partial lighting 
for museum interior, and two triggers. The first trigger gives the player the mission objective 
and the second trigger, placed in front of the treasure in the museum, congratulates the player 
and quits the game. I am sorry it is about an hour late. I had initailly committed it to my personal github
instead of the schools. I did not release the error untill I tried to add you to the project.
